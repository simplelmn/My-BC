## Task
CLI calculator project should be created

## Description
1)  We splited string into tokens. For example, "123+(6-2)*4/2%2" string was given,
    then we have done like ["123", "+", "(", "6", "-", "2", ")", "*", "4", "/", "2", "%", "2"]
2)  We have use stack
3)  We used infix & postfix notation

A valid expression:
    • must only contain the operators +, -, *, /, and modulo (percent)
    • must only have integer values
    • can contain parentheses, but each group must be properly closed
    • can contain spaces
Since we are doing whole number arithmetic, divisions are euclidian keeping only the quotient, while the remainder can be obtained with a modulo operation.

## Installation
This depends on your system. If you use Windows you have to install GCC compiler, and make sure to be able to run make.
If you use Linux or MacOs no need installation

## Usage
1) run with `make` command
2) `./my_bc "12-3*2*(6-5)"`
